    "A graph can exist in different forms having the same number of vertices, edges. Such graphs are called isomorphic graphs.[[1]](https://www.javatpoint.com/graph-isomorphism-in-discrete-mathematics) From what I could understand from this. Two graphs are able to be equal if they have the exact same dimensions, but two graphs can look the same even if they aren’t, and that is the idea behind graph isomorphisms."
